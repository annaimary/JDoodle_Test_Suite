# JDoodle_Test_Suite
 JDoodle_Test_Suite created by Annaimary
 Hi Team,
    I have created this test suite with Playwright + Typescript + Cucumber.
    I have added five test cases in BDD style.
    Execution test reports are generated in Cucumber report as well as using muliple-cucumber-html-reporter under test-results\reports folder
    Loggers also generated.
    Test data separated and stored in util
With Regards,
